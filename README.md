I tried to use Quarto, but there's some compliance issue that I cannot render. I am still trying to figure out what is going on but there isn't too much resource online to help for debugging:(

Yaqi - Week 6 lab completed: I have a problem compiling into pdf when I load large stan output file [My random guess is that R dont like output with 100+MB similar as GitHub :( ] thus I have it compile it into html. The pdf in the folder is printed from the html thus it looks a bit weird. I would recommend looking at the html version of the result. Sorry for the inconvenience.
